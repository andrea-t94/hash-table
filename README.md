# hash-table
I want to replicate built-in Python hash table to better understand its functioning. Moreover I apply TDD framework to make sure it's working as expected


## TO DO
1. finish typing of custom hash
2. add requirements of custom hash
3. add tests for requirements (later) and compare with common hash
4. start building hash table with common hash
